// Thread is a conversation session between an Assistant and a user.
// Threads store Messages and automatically handle truncation to fit content into a modelâ€™s context.
// Due to [Thread Locks], the same thread could not be ran by multiple goroutines simultaneously.
//
// If ID is empty or the thread with the given ID does not exist,
// a new thread will be created on the server with the given information.
// Otherwise, the thread with the given ID will be used and other fields are ignored.
//
// It's suggested that save the thread ID in the users' session and reuse it for the following runs
// in the short duration, or save it into the database for the long duration.
//
